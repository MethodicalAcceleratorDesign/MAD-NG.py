0.6.0 (2024/12/05)
Remove `debug` input variable functionality, now it is only a boolean, and dictates whether the debug information is printed to the console. \
Add `stdout` input to the `MAD` object, this allows the user to redirect the output of the MAD-NG process to a file. \
Add `redirect_stderr` input to the `MAD` object, this allows the user to redirect the error output to the stdout file. \
Add `raise_on_madng_error` input to the `MAD` object, which is on by default. This significantly changes current behaviour, now by default whenever MAD-NG raises an error, this will be received in the pipe to Python. Set to false to revert to the old behaviour. \
Expose `protected_send` method to the user, this allows the user to send a protected string to MAD-NG. Only has different behaviour to `send` if `raise_on_madng_error` is set to false. \

0.5.0 (2024/10/30)

Add `history` method to get the history of communication of strings to MAD-NG. \
Rename a significant amount of the code to be more readable. \
Format the code using ruff. \
Convert to using `annotations` instead of `typing`. \
Allow debug mode to be set to a string, which will be the file that the debug information is written to. \
Remove support for Python EOL, now only supporting Python 3.9 and above. \
Change how ctrl-c is handled, now it will raise a KeyboardInterrupt error and delete the MAD process.

0.4.6 (2024/01/17)

No change, releasing with MAD 0.9.8-1

0.4.5 (2024/01/17)

No change, releasing with MAD 0.9.8

0.4.4 (2023/11/27)

Remove and test bug where pymadng is not made aware of error during calling an object, leading to returning of incorrect data.

0.4.3 (2023/11/25)

Update GitHub Actions to always use the latest version of MAD-NG \
Update tests to be more robust.

0.4.2 (2023/10/18)

Add `to_df` method to objects, allowing for easy conversion to pandas dataframes. \

0.4.1 (2023/08/19)

Change the way `send_vars` and `recv_vars` work, they now use kwargs and args respectively. \
Fix bug with receiving lists. \
Allow tuples to be sent and received (they are converted to lists). \
Completely refactor the underlying process again (this time for symmetry). \
Update Documentation. \
Ensure that the binaries are included on PyPI. \
Allow multiple processes with different `__last__` objects. \
Allow receiving of multiple objects in the syntax `a, b = mad["a", "b"]` (for symmetry and simplistic). \
Set pymadng to now be in beta.

0.4.0 (2023/06/26)

Fix MADX issue
Move binaries to the bin folder \
Update MAD-NG binaries \
Rename files to start with madp_... \
Completely refactor underlying process and remove reliance on mad objects, mad strings and `__last__`, now the process is completely self contained and can be separated into MAD-NG itself.
